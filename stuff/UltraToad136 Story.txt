Toad awoke one day to his life staring him right in the face. His beloved girlfriend Toadette had been forcefully taken by none other than the evil Dwayne Johnson. Toad's mission became immediately obvious, it was time to "Rock" Dwayne's world and end his reign of terror.

Toad proceeded to find his ultra-gun-69, strap on his mushroom shaped headcone and grab his keys.

It wasn't before long that Toad found himself in a familiar land, he'd been here before, but he struggled to recall.


"Mushroom Kingdom" Toad screeched. It was once a land of peace and prosperity until....Wrestlemania aired and caused everyone to turn into tiny mushroom-based obscenities

Toad survived Wrestlemania of 97', now it was his time to strike back and save the girl. Toad stood tall and screeched at the top of his voice "I am Toad, Ultra Toad"
